# Sign-Language-Detection

Sign language is a crucial means of communication for individuals with hearing impairments. However, interpreting sign language can be challenging for those unfamiliar with its intricacies. In recent years, the advancement of deep learning techniques has shown promise in developing automated systems for sign language recognition. This project proposes a novel approach that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Mediapipe to detect and interpret sign language gestures in real-time.
